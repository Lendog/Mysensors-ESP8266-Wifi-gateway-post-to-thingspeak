# Mysensors ESP8266 Wifi gateway post to thingspeak

Intended to work with Mysensors library 2.0   and ESP board manager 2.3.0

Please note this has not been tested yet, it does compile without errors but havenâ€™t tested beyond that. I don't have any sensors running on Mysensors library 2.0 at the moment hopefully i'll try to update mysensors soon.
